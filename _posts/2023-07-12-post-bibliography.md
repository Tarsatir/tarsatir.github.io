The distinction between predictive and causal explanations is often treated as fundamental in various scientific disciplines. Predictive models aim to forecast outcomes based on input data, while causal models seek to understand the underlying mechanisms that give rise to those outcomes. However, from a pragmatic standpoint, this distinction becomes blurrier. Essentially, both types of models serve as predictive tools; they are both attempts to anticipate future states or outcomes based on current and past information.

### Predictive Models Are Implicitly Causal

At the core of any predictive model lies a simplified representation of reality that captures the relationships between variables of interest. These relationships may not be explicitly causal, but they are not entirely devoid of causality either. For instance, a machine learning model predicting stock prices is built on an implicit assumption that past prices, volumes, and other factors somehow 'cause' or 'influence' future prices, even if this causality is not articulated. Thus, prediction implicitly demands some form of causal reasoning, albeit one that is not thoroughly scrutinized.

### Causal Models Are Inherently Predictive
Conversely, causal models are intrinsically predictive in nature. Knowing the causal structure of a system offers the ability to predict what will happen under different interventions. Suppose we know that smoking causes lung cancer. This causal knowledge predicts that if we reduce smoking rates, we should observe a corresponding decrease in lung cancer cases. The causal explanation, although deeper and perhaps more satisfying from an epistemological standpoint, ultimately serves a predictive function.

### Utility in Practice
From a practical perspective, what matters is how well a model can guide decisions. In fields like economics, medicine, or engineering, the ultimate test of any model—be it predictive or causal—is its ability to reliably inform decisions that lead to desired outcomes. Whether you are predicting the effect of a drug or understanding the causal mechanisms of its actions, the pragmatic goal remains the same: to anticipate the consequences of administering that drug.

### The Cost of Distinction
Maintaining a rigid distinction between predictive and causal models can even be counterproductive. In a rapidly evolving field like data science, the lines are often blurred. Hybrid models that combine machine learning techniques for prediction with structural equations for causal inference are increasingly common. Insisting on categorizing these models as either predictive or causal can hinder interdisciplinary collaboration and impede scientific progress.

In summary, while the intellectual distinction between predictive and causal models may be useful for the clarity of scientific discourse, from a pragmatic standpoint, they serve the same purpose: prediction. Both types of models aim to generalize from known data to unknown scenarios, and both are tested against their ability to do so effectively. Therefore, it's reasonable to argue that the predictive vs. causal dichotomy has limited pragmatic value and that, in essence, all models are predictive.
