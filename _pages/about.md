As a Ph.D. candidate at the [Computational Science Lab](https://uva.computationalscience.nl/), my work intersects stochastic modeling, information theory, game theory, and network theory. My goal is to refine methodologies that unravel complex questions about economic development, global poverty and fundamental questions in governance.

My academic path began with a deep interest in complex systems within biology, leading me to study physics. This journey evolved into applying these scientific frameworks to social sciences, particularly in understanding cooperation emergence and policy processes.

Currently, my research focuses on three key questions: methodologies that allow to effectively aggregating information from various sources into consistent economic models, identifying the right scales for analyzing economic growth, and understanding the necessary conditions that lead to coordination failure in economic development.

Apart from research, I engage in diverse teaching roles, covering theoretical physics, quantum physics, and agent-based modeling. My teaching philosophy emphasizes transparency in thought processes and conceptual understanding, empowering students to make their own informed decisions.

I work on problems related to economic development and poverty using computational science and applied mathematics. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
