As a Ph.D. candidate at the [Computational Science Lab](https://uva.computationalscience.nl/), my work intersects several fields of study which are for the most part, not traditionally associated with each other. Those fields include economics, physics, and computer science. Im motivated by improving methodologies that provide guidance for policy-making and economic development, specifically in the context of economic development and global poverty.

My academic path began with a deep interest in complex systems within biology, leading me to study physics, molecular modelling techniques. Gathering more modelling tools and better understanding of them, sparked my interest in applying these to social sciences, particularly in understanding cooperation emergence and policy processes.

Currently, my research focuses on three key questions: methodologies that allow to effectively aggregating information from various sources into one consistent model, identifying the right scales for analyzing economic development, and understanding the necessary conditions that lead to coordination failure in social systems.

I work on problems related to economic development and poverty using computational science and applied mathematics. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
