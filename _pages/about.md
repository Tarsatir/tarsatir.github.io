As a Ph.D. candidate at the [Computational Science Lab](https://uva.computationalscience.nl/), my work intersects several fields of study, which include economics, physics, and computer science. These fields intersect yet remain distinct. I'm motivated by the goal of improving methodologies that provide guidance for policy-making and economic development, specifically in the context of development, global poverty, and collective decision-making.

Starting from an interest in complex systems within biology, which led me to study physics and molecular modeling techniques, I expanded my skills in generating and interpreting models. I then observed that such approaches are underutilized in the social sciences, particularly in understanding the emergence of cooperation and policy processes.

My current research focuses on three key questions: methodologies that allow for the effective aggregation of information from various sources into one consistent model, identifying the appropriate scales for analyzing economic development, and understanding the conditions that lead to coordination failure in social systems.

I work on problems related to economic development and poverty using computational science and applied mathematics. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
